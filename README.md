# Exploring-H2O-and-Tensorflow-in-R
Aim- Exploring scalability issues in R using H2O package and image classification using Tensorflow.

Renthop dataset from Kaggle was used. Random Forest, GBM and Deep Learing models in H2O were used to predict the number of inquiries a new listing receives based on the listingâ€™s creation date and other features. Image classification was then peformed using tensorflow to classify the images in the dataset.
